# The Weather Scraper (ðŸŒ©â›ˆðŸŒ¤ðŸŒžðŸŒ¨)
Need High-resolution Weather Data for Analytics or Machine-learning ? Seek no more.

## Overview
The Weather Scraper downloads high-resolution weather data (often 5 min. intervals) from Wunderground's public weather stations around the world for you.

#### Install dependencies (use Python3)
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### TLDR
```python
python weather_scraper.py
```  

### How to run TWS?
First, find the weather stations you are looking for.  
Then you just have to update 2 config files before running TWS. 

1. Go to https://www.wunderground.com/wundermap and zoom in to your location  
    ðŸŒž Click on a weather station and then click on the **Station ID**  (the Station Summary page will open)  
    ðŸŒž Open and copy all Station ID URLs you need  

2. Set the weather_station urls inside **stations.txt**  
    ðŸŒž *one url per line!*  

3. Inside **config.py**  
    ðŸŒž Set the date-range you want to download your data from  
    ðŸŒž Set the unit system you need (metric / imperial)  
    ðŸŒž Set FIND_FIRST_DATE to true if you want the weather scraper to use binary search to search for the first date with data, starting from START_DATE  

If you want to download data from 2020/5/1 to 2020/6/1 in metric units your config.py will look like this:
```python
from datetime import date

# Set Date format like: YYYY, MM, DD
START_DATE = date(2020, 5, 1)
END_DATE = date(2020, 6, 1)
# set to "metric" or "imperial"
UNIT_SYSTEM = "metric"

# Automatically find first date where data is logged
FIND_FIRST_DATE = False
```

Now you are ready to run your downloads:
```sh
$ python weather_scraper.py
```
Wait until TWS finishes writing your data to files with this naming pattern ***station_name.csv***!  

You resulting CSV file will look something like this (if you format it nicely)
